    "* generate a word cloud based on the raw corpus\n",
    "* perform a standard text preprocessing consisting in tokenization, stemming and/or lemmatization and stopwords removal\n",
    "* perform a sentiment analysis to know what H.Clinton thinks of each country, using the library pycountry\n",

    "We first perform a sentiment analysis on every email message. On the dataframe characterizing each email, we add a field \"Sentiment\" that corresponds to the sentiment that emanates from the message. We have tried the `SentimentIntensityAnalyzser` method of `nltk.sentiment.vader` module, and the Liu-Hu lexicon using the `opinion_lexicon` from `nltk.corpus`. We will try to compare the results. \n",
